Soundbot - Plug.dj
======

__*This is no longer being developed. If I see someone that has forked it and done substantial improvments over time, I will transfer the repository to them. However, if the repository gets transferred, they must include a link to my [github](http://github.com/fourbitus).*__

The bot will not work currently, due to plug.dj API changes.

###Rationale

__*Many features are inspired by the great tastybot. All hail. :octocat:*__

Soundbot is written in Javascript to take advantage of [plug.dj's](http://plug.dj) API.
There are bugs and if you would like to help squash them, please make an issue if you encounter, and try to include the following:

1. Short, detailed description
2. Console error (Press F12 -> console tab, it should say on the right [bot.js]. On the left is the error.)
3. Line number (this may not be always available)
4. 

If you are new to Javascript, and would like to contribute, [here is a link to a pretty good website that helps with the basics.](http://codecademy.com). Run through it. I've found that "coding to learn is better than learning to code".

For more advanced stuff and syntax highlighting, [go here to look at some documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference).

###__*This was designed to be run on FireFox*__
__If you can help with some compatibilty with chrome, that'd be great.__

####Uniform

This is meant for a guideline on how the code is easier to read and evaluate.

__Refer [here](https://github.com/FourBitus/Sound/wiki/Code-Submissions) for the guidelines.__
